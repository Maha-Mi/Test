    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The Fulbright Program was created in 1946 through the vision of Senator J. William Fulbright.

    <h2>The First Fulbright Exchange</h2>
    <p>The first exchange program began in 1948 with the establishment of the Fulbright scholarship for students and professionals. The initial focus was on fostering academic and cultural exchange between the United States and Europe, but it quickly expanded globally to include over 160 countries.</p>

    <h2>Impact and Legacy</h2>
    <p>Since its inception, the Fulbright Program has provided millions of people with the opportunity to gain international experience. Many prominent leaders, academics, and artists have participated in the program, contributing significantly to diplomacy, global research, and the arts. The program's influence continues to thrive today, with over 8,000 grants awarded annually in various categories such as study, teaching, and research.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The U.S. Fulbright Program remains one of the most successful educational exchange programs in the world, helping bridge gaps between cultures and creating lasting connections that continue to foster peace, academic excellence, and global understanding.</p>
